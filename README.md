# Perspective Backend Engineer Worksample

Good day!

This is the code part to the written work sample. In here you can find a simple API setup. 
The tests are working, so you can run `npm test` and start from there.

In the `/samples` folder you can find sample users which you can feed to your system. 


## Goal
1. Create a endpoint that accepts a user and stores it in a database.
2. Create a endpoint which returns (all) users from the database.
   * This endpoint should be able to receive a query parameter `created` which sorts users by creation date ascending or descending.

Feel free to add or change this project as you like.
