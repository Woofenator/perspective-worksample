# Perspective Backend Engineer Worksample

This project skeleton contains a basic Express setup one endpoint to create a user and one endpoint to fetch all users, as well as a basic empty unit test.

## Scripts 
`npm start` starts the server

`npm test` executes the tests

## Goal
1. Adjust one endpoint so it accepts a user and stores it in a database.
2. Adjust one endpoint so it returns (all) users from the database.
   * This endpoint should be able to receive a query parameter `created` which sorts users by creation date ascending or descending.

Feel free to add or change this project as you like.
